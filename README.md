### Zen

Zen is a blog app using Node.js & MongoDB, inspired by [yang6233562/y](https://github.com/yang6233562/y).

Demo: [Zenblog](http://zen.phoenixlzx.com:3000)

#### Usage

1. Install Node.js & MongoDB on your server. Note: Install Node.js via [visionmedia/n](https://github.com/visionmedia/n) is recommended, as some distro have old Nodejs versions.

2. `git clone https://github.com/phoenixlzx/zen.git && cd zen && npm install`

3. Edit `config.js.example` and rename to `config.js`

4. `node app.js`

5. Done!

**ATTENTION** 

You **MUST** leave `allowReg` to `true` before you register at least 1 user. You could set it to `false` after you have successfully registered and restart the app.

#### Contribute

##### Translate

I hope this project can be available to the massive. Translation works need less knowledge of programming so most people can do this.

Our translation is hosted on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/zen/), feel free to join us or request new translate team if you want to contribute.

##### Code

Pull requests are always welcome. 

Any help -- a better/simpler way to implement the function, bug report, new idea, new theme.. etc, will be appreciated.
