Pull requests are welcome!

Demo: [Zenblog](http://zen.phoenixlzx.com:3000)

#### Usage

1. Install Node.js & MongoDB on your server. Note: Install Node.js via [visionmedia/n](https://github.com/visionmedia/n) is recommended, as some distro have old Nodejs versions.

3. Edit config.js

4. `node app.js`

5. Done!
